git add <filename>
git commit -m 'comment'
git push origin main

I have questions about git.

Do I need to use the add command even if I have made that file already? e.g., do edits get 'added'?

In the commit command, what does the '-m' option do?

Why don't I see it in my git repository online? How long does it take to upload?
